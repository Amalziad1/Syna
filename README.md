## Description
As most communities consist of people with disablities, especially with deaf individuals, who can't hear or talk, while deaf individuals use sign language to communicate with people, many can't understand them, and even if normal people learnt sign language, they may not fully understand deaf people's gestures, their ideas, and thoughts. This is our main problem and we want to study it by invloving AI model and application that will help both sides (deaf and normal persons). 

Our AI (Syna) bridges the gap by recognizing and translating sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time. It ensures that communication between deaf and hearing individuals becomes easier and more accessible.

Using AI2Web3 app hand and face tracking models, Syna detects gestures instantly. When the AI is confident, the translation is displayed right away. If unsure, it securely sends keyframes to the cloud AI for verification which ensures high accuracy without compromising user privacy.

To enhance its performance, Syna uses federated learning which allows its AI models to improve directly on user devices without sharing personal data. Decentralized AI agents work together to update and refine the model continuously.

Based on blockchain smart contracts, Syna manages AI tasks and ensures transparency. Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS keep data secure and accessible.

With all these information, we decided to choose Syna as our AI name which is derived from the word "synapse" that represents connection and communication. Our goal with Syna is to provide a reliable, secure, and intelligent tool that improves communication for everyone which will make conversations with deaf individuals more natural and meaningful.
